# Welcome to my profile! My name is Gamaliel
## I am starting my path as a software developer.

As an experienced developer, I am constantly seeking for oportunities to get involved in new software development areas. Being self-taught and patient are some of my best attributes, as well as being always committed to my work.

I have around 4 year of experience working as a junior and middle software developer, both in frontend and backend, currently focused on improving my skills in the backend side.

I have worked with HTML, CSS, Javascript, as well as frameworks like Bootstrap and Angular with Typescript. In addition, I know the basics of some design patterns (repository, dependency injection, SOLID). Also, I have a strong background related to backend technologies, like node.js, C# and python, using frameworks like .NET and FastAPI, ORMs like EF Core, Dapper, pymongo and Odoo ORM, as well as some fundamentals of databases (tables, views, stored procedures, normalization), using Microsoft SQL Server, MongoDB and PostreSQL as database managers.
