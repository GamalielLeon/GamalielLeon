# Welcome to my profile! My name is Gamaliel.
## I am starting my path as a software developer.

As a recent graduate mechatronics engineer, I am constantly seeking for oportunities to get involved in the programming and software development areas. Being self-taught and patient are some of my best attributes, as well as being always committed to my work.

I have almost a year of experience (11 months) working as a junior software developer, both in frontend and backend, currently focused on improving my skills in the frontend side.

I have worked with HTML, CSS, Javascript, as well as frameworks like Bootstrap and Angular with Typescript. In addition, I know the basics of some design patterns (repository, dependency injection, SOLID). Also, I have some background related to backend technologies, like node.js, C#, frameworks like .NET, ORMs like EF Core, Dapper and Mongoose, as well as some fundamentals of databases (tables, views, stored procedures, normalization), using Microsoft SQL Server and MongoDB as database managers.
