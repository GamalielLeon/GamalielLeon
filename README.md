# Welcome to my profile! My name is Gamaliel.
## I am starting my path as a software developer.

As a recent graduate mechatronics engineer, I am constantly seeking for oportunities to get involved in the programming and software development areas. Being self-taught and patient are some of my best attributes, as well as being always committed to my work.

Currently, I have almost a year of experience (11 months) working as a junior software developer, both in frontend and backend, currently focused on improving my skills in the frontend side.
